# Spotify Clone (Frontend Only)

This project is a frontend clone of Spotify built using React and Vite. It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React + Vite:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About the Project

This is just the **frontend** implementation of the Spotify UI for learning and practice purposes.

**I aim to finish it with a backend after learning backend development.** For now, this project is focused only on the frontend side.

Feel free to fork, contribute, or suggest improvements!
